  <p>Semiconductors are materials which have
     a conductivity between conductors (generally metals) and
      nonconductors or insulators (such as most ceramics).</p>
  <p style="margin-top:50px;">Semiconductors can be pure elements,
      such as silicon or germanium, or compounds such as gallium
      arsenide or cadmium selenide.A semiconductor material has an electrical
      conductivity value falling between that of a conductor,
      such as metallic copper, and an insulator, such as glass.
      Its resistivity falls as its temperature rises;
      metals are the opposite. Its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities
      ("doping") into the crystal structure.</p>
